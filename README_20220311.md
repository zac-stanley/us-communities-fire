## Part I: Project Description 
This project will be an interactive map that visualizes United States communities at moderate to very high potential of wildfire and rates of a set of social vulnerabilities that exist within those communities. The results of the analysis visualized in the map will help reveal at a general level specific communities that could benefit from additional emergency response planning efforts based on the combination of the input datasets. This map will also potentially reveal communities in locations not commonly thought to be at risk for wildfire. The result of this will serve to potentially change the perception that wildfire risks only exist in the western United States

## II: Methodology
There are three key datasets that will be used to perform analysis and visualize the results.

### A. Data

### Wildfire Hazard Potential  

1. [2020 Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP) for the United States](https://www.fs.usda.gov/rmrs/datasets/wildfire-hazard-potential-united-states-270-m-version-2020-3rd-edition). This is a 270-m spatial resolution raster dataset that classifies Wildfire Hazard Potential in the conterminous United States into 5-discrete classes based on percentile breaks:   
       
    - **Class 1:** Very Low
    - **Class 2:** Low
    - **Class 3:** Moderate
    - **Class 4:** High
    - **Class 5:** Very High  

   From the metadata: WHP is an index that quantifies the relative potential for wildfire that may be difficult to control, used as a measure to help prioritize where fuel treatments may be needed.  

   This data won't be displayed on the final map, it will simply be used as an input to define and refine communities that should be further analyzed based on their proxitmity to Wildfire Hazard Potential.  

### Census Designated Places  

2. [U.S. Census Designated Places](https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/GENZ2020/shp/cb_2020_us_place_500k.zip). These are simplified representations of selected geographic areas from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). These boundary files are specifically designed for small-scale thematic mapping.  

This dataset will be the core spatial component of this project and will be repressented in the final product as graduated symbols based on the geometric center of the polygon at max scale and when zoomed in the map will display the full geometry of the polygon. These data will be loaded into the map as geoJSON files.

### Social Vulnerability Index  

3. [Centers for Disease Control Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/documentation/SVI_documentation_2018.html). This data is available at the tract level and has four individual vulnerability components:  

- Socioeconmic
- Household Composition & Disability
- Minority Status & Language
- Housing Type & Transportation
 
As well as a summary ranking.
