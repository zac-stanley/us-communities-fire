# California Communities at Risk:
## **Where are the vulnerable in relation to fire risk**  
I want to design a map that allows the vizualization of high burn probability locations and vulnerable populations in the state of California. I would like to map this topic because it has the potential identify geographies that are particularly at risk from both a natural resource perspective but also from a human one, and that convergence could be more meaningful than either of those factors on their own. I think this could be a particularly helpful tool for policy makers and resource managers in helping them plan fuel treatments, whether certain social services may be required (rides for the disabled in an emergency etc.) fire mitigation strategies and simply where need is greatest.  

**Input datasets for the proposed vulnerable lands and people interative map:**
