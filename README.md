## Final Project Ideas for New Maps Plus
**Topic 1: Interactive Bi-variate Potential Fire Fuels Map**  
I want to design a map that explores the relationship between burn probability and above ground live biomass in the state of California. I'm interested in exploring this topic to identify areas that might have high burn probability, and a potentially low above ground live biomass. This could potentially equate with areas that might need specific types of fuel treatment for dealing with dead biomass. Additionally, low burn probability areas and high above ground live biomass could be indicative of areas that lack dead fuels, have properly thinned/treated forests and/or have vegetation types that that are not particularly fire prone. The audience of fire planners and resource managers could use the map as a tool in the priortization process of where to distribute treatment resources for fire mitigation.  
Input datasets for the bi-variate map are two rasters:  
[Aboveground live tree biomass (k=10)](https://lemma.forestry.oregonstate.edu/projects/ca-biomass)
[Annual Burn Probability](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/32de73f1cfb040c79f80c189ccefe061)
