# California Communities in Harms Way:
## **Where are the vulnerable in relation to fire risk**  
This project will attempt to visualize vulnerable communities throughout the state of California that are at particular risk to wildfire. It will do so through through *spatial analysis* and *web development*.  

The *spatial analysis* component will first look at wildfire risk as the initial metric - areas with moderate to high fire will dertmine. The results of this will then be intersected U.S. Census designated places \(dps\) polygons \(I need research an appropriate buffer distance that takes into account how far a fire can spread\). The dps will be joined to a series of metrics likely including: housing status \(rent or own\), car ownership, age \(senior or child\), education, poverty rate, disability rate, language barriers, incarceration rate. These metrics will be combined to create a weighted vulberability index by which communities can be ranked.

I want to design a map that allows the vizualization of high burn probability locations and vulnerable populations in the state of California. I would like to map this topic because it has the potential identify geographies that are particularly at risk from both a natural resource perspective but also from a human one, and that convergence could be more meaningful than either of those factors on their own. I think this could be a particularly helpful tool for policy makers and resource managers in helping them plan fuel treatments, whether certain social services may be required (rides for the disabled in an emergency etc.) fire mitigation strategies and simply where need is greatest.
